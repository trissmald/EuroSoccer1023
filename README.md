# EuroSoccer1023

Hi, I've created my first data analysis project (actually it was my third or so but it's the first one I've finished, I'm proud). In this project I had to use several webscrapping tools together with Python pandas to analyze 13 years of European soccer. In this project we used Python notebooks to create the corresponding analysis code together with the Pandas library. I wanted to do a project in which I need to apply several tools, from obtaining the information, cleaning, correction and generation of the visualization by means of PowerBI.

I have left the files in the project so you can review them, leave me comments and take them as a reference in case you are also learning about data analysis like me. I have also left two csv files, so I will explain why.

The cleaned version is the generation of the file after eliminating more than 30,000 rows of information that were incomplete (this is explained inside the python notebook) so I proceeded to make the corresponding cleaning, the version without cleaning is this same with the totality of data (+90,000) in case you want to clean it in a different way.

Anyway, in the code itself you can extract this information.

The information was downloaded directly from https://www.football-data.co.uk/data.php, so you can check it out.

In the code, I explain in depth the processes, I invite you to review it.

For the report I would have liked to be able to add it dynamically here but I didn't manage to do it, so you can see it from [here:](https://app.powerbi.com/view?r=eyJrIjoiMGVmY2JkNWItNTQxYy00YTI0LTk0NmMtZjY1ZDFhZjE0YTk1IiwidCI6ImNhY2E5MDExLTdiNmEtNDRkZS04NjFmLTA5NWEyY2E4ODNiNyIsImMiOjR9&pageName=ReportSection).
